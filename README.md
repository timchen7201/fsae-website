You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


## Deployment
I take firebase as example,install firebase CLI first

`npm install -g firebase-tools`

then make some configuration

`firebase init`

the following options are:

- Hosting: Configure and deploy Firebase Hosting sites
- What do you want to use as your public directory?(build)
- Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? (y)
- Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub? No
- File build/index.html already exists. Overwrite? No

And then appoint firebase project

`firebase use [project_id]`

And build and deploy

`npm run build && firebase deploy`
